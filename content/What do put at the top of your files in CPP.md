title: What do put at the top of your files in CPP
---
# What do you put at the top of your files?
- `cout` - stream object
- `#include` directive results in contents of another file to be inserted into the program
	- e.g., `#include <iostream>` brings in the iostream library and would allow statements such as `cout` to be read properly
