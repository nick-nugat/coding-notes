## Tree terminology
- "roots" are at the top and they are the only node with **no parent**.
- trees can be empty
- height = num of levels

## Traversing a tree
- each item is visited **exactly once**
- order of traversal is **NOT unique**
- uses **recursion**
- to visit all nodes
	- visit root
	- visit all nodes on **root's left subtree**
	- visit all nodes on **root's right subtree**
