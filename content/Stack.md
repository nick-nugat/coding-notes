## Stack
> LIFO (last in, first out)

> [!example]
> The last item inserted is the first item out (like a stack irl).

- pop() -> removes top element
	- delete
	- query
- push() -> adds element to top
	- insert
- peek() -> returns element on top

### When would I want to use a Stack?
- making sure parentheses line up in an expression
	- if nothing on stack -> everything lines up
	- otherwise, there was a left parenthesis not aligned correctly
