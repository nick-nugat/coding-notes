# Java Basics
* go through CSAwesome course
* type "done" on canvas for pretest assignment
* press "score me" when finished
* IDE"s
	* Visual Studio Code
	* Eclipse
* Java is not the best intro language (but it's still possible lol, I'll hold onto that sliver of hope)
	* language is very syntax-heavy
* doesn't require indentation
* "public class" - makes a class and you can name it
	```java
	public class MyClass
	
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			System.out.println("Hi there!");
			// "println" inserts text on the line and goes to the next one
			// "print" just prints the code on the same line
		}
	}
	```
- remember your brackets - very important
- remember semicolons to end a line of code
- comments in java
	```java
	// single line comment
	
	/* multi
	   line
	   comments
	*/
	```
- "int" - short for integer
```java
int x = 10;
```
