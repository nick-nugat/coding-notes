# Java Syntax Fundamentals
- make sure you see AP_JAVA_22_23 at the top left while going through [CSAwesome](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/AP_Java_22_23/index.html) or data doesn't save ðŸ’€

```java
int num = 10;
// stores integer numbers

double gpa = 3.9;
// stores floating point numbers (decimals)
// double -> variable types (byte, short, long, float)

boolean isRaining = false;
// true or false
// boolean statments declare if something is ON or OFF

char Letter = 'A';
// "primitive data types"
// ASCII table; "A" = 65 on tableâ€”

String name = "Sally";
// stores sequences of characters
// "String" is an object, not primitive
```

- declaring and assigning a variable have different purposes

> [! ] ok nvm my teacher got the same exact error for csawesome lmao my laptop is still kinda poo tho lol
- variable names - make them simple; use common sense
	- has to start lowercase
	- make them short and simple
	- reserved words or keywords cannot be used as variable names in Java (for, if, class, static, int, double, etc.)
