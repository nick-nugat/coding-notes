# Hashing
- can be used to locate elements in a [[Data structures|data structure]] without searching linearly
- hash functions compute an integer value (hash code) from an object

> [!important]
> Make sure to minimize collisions as much as possible.

## Examples
### Computing hash code from object `x`
```java
int h = x.hashCode();
```

###  Identifying students at MC
