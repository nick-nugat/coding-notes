# Hashing
- can be used to locate elements in a [[Data structures|data structure]] without searching linearly
- hash functions compute an integer value (hash code) from an object

- common way to scale integer is to use the `%` (modulo) operator

```java
code % n //good to use an odd num for `n`
```
## Examples
### Computing hash code from object `x`
```java
int h = x.hashCode();
```

###  Identifying students
- use their student id because it's unique

## Fixing collisions
